It was a dark and stormy night.. Three mischievous mice were up late, dining on cheese and wine, when suddenly they heard a loud pounding on the door: _TOK! TOK! TOK!_

"I wonder who could that be ... in this weather none the less?" questioned Minnie.

"I wonder if Donald finally made it.. he's been gone for hours!" said Mickey

Tom get ups from his chair and scampers to the door. He tip toes to look through the peep hole.

All of a sudden the door flinges open & a large cloud of smoke spreads into the room. Tom goes flying across the room.

Mickey and Minnie both leap out their chairs. Minnie goes to the aid of Tom, on the floor, "O cheesus". Mickey picks up the charcuterie board from the table, spilling all the wine and cheese on the floor, and uses it as a makeshift wooden shield.
